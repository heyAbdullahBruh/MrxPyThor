#ðŸ”® Magic Methods in Python (also called dunder methods) are special methods that start and end with double underscores like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.
# They let you define how your objects behave with built-in functions and operators.

| Magic Method             | Purpose                           | Example Use       |
| -------------------------| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `__init__(self,other)`   | Constructor                       | `obj = MyClass()` |
| `__str__(self,other)`    | String representation (for print) | `print(obj)`      |
| `__repr__(self,other)`   | Official string (for debugging)   | `repr(obj)`       |
| `__len__(self,other)`    | Length of object                  | `len(obj)`        |
| `__add__(self,other)`    | Addition operator (`+`)           | `obj1 + obj2`     |
| `__sub__(self,other)`    | Substraction operator (`-`)       | `obj1 - obj2`     |
| `__mul__(self,other)`    | Multiply operator (`*`)           | `obj1 * obj2`     |
| `__div__(self,other)`    | Division operator (`/`)           | `obj1 / obj2`     |
| `__eq__(self,other)`     | Equality (`==`)                   | `obj1 == obj2`    |
| `__ne__(self,other)`     | not equal (`!=`)                  | `obj1 != obj2`    |
| `__lt__(self,other)`     | Less than (`<`)                   | `obj1 < obj2`     |
| `__le__(self,other)`     | Less than equal (`<=`)            | `obj1 < obj2`     |
| `__gt__(self,other)`     | grater than (`>`)                 | `obj1 > obj2`     |
| `__ge__(self,other)`     | grater than equal (`>=`)          | `obj1 > obj2`     |
